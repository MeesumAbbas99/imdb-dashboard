# IMDb Movies Dashboard and Analysis Notebook

This project includes an interactive dashboard and a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing IMDb's Top 1000 Movies dataset. The dashboard provides functionalities for univariate and bivariate analysis, while the notebook contains detailed preprocessing, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.

## Features
### Dashboard
- **Landing Page**:
  - Upload a dataset and view it as a table.
  - Navigate to different analysis pages.
- **Univariate Analysis**:
  - View the distribution of numerical attributes using histograms.
- **Bivariate Analysis**:
  - Visualize relationships between numerical attributes with scatter plots.

### Notebook
The Python notebook (`imdb_analysis_notebook.ipynb`) provides:
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Adjusting data types.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
